# Physical_design_using_openlane.DAY-1-Introduction to openlane
 
This repository is all about the physical design using the open source EDA tool,that is openlane.Openlane is open source environment which is used to run stimulus.It is very compatible with paid EDA tools.Before going into the topic lets learn the basic terminologies of chip.
The below diagram shows us the arduino board which is a basic board.We can easily identify the chip in the board.That is the chip focussing on from now on wards.

From the figure we can navigate easily the chip which is palced on the board.It is shown in the square box with leads outside as we dipicted in the picture.

Inside that box as we say simply,the structure is shown in above.The white colour line on the square box is called pins or leads which are placed for the purpose of connecting ths I/O devices outside the chip.

The area shown as a chip is called core area.Inside the chip contains transistors and some electronic devices like capacitors,resistors,inductors and power supplt lines.
Pads are the area where connection points at the chips exterior that connects the package of the chip.
Die is the core without the package outside it.Simply it is the fabricated area without pin mapping.
IPS is abbreviated as "Inches Per Square" which is a parameter to specify number of components on the chip.As number of components on the chip increases the density of components will increase.
